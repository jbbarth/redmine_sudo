Redmine Sudo plugin
===================

This plugin allows administrators of a redmine instance to change their rights temporarily and navigate as if they were normal users. Then they can take back their administrator rights only when needed. It's the same idea as "sudo" in Linux/Unix operating systems, you don't need to be root all the time.

The plugin also allows to define some CSS that will only be included when you're administrator, so that you can always obviously know your status. See below the 3rd screenshot, the proposed styles change the header background colors to red.

Screenshot
----------

Here's a screenshot when you're a standard user:

If you click on it you become administrator:

The admin section lets you define the title of the links and some CSS styles that will be applied only when admin:

**plugin requirement:**
* this plugin requires the plugin [redmine_base_deface](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_deface) to be installed!

Then you basically just have to:
